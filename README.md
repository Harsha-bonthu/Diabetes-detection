DIABETES DETECTION:
# Machine Learning Model Comparison and Optimization

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Diabetes-detection.ipynb`) that demonstrates a comprehensive machine learning workflow for a classification task. It covers data preprocessing, training and evaluating multiple classification models, hyperparameter tuning, and visualizing model performance and feature importance. The project also includes checks for overfitting and model stability.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to build and compare various machine learning classification models to identify the best performer for a given dataset. The workflow is designed to be robust, incorporating techniques like stratified K-Fold cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance and generalization. The final optimized model and its associated preprocessing steps are saved for easy future deployment.

## Features

-   **Data Loading & Preprocessing**:
    * Loads data from a CSV file (`final dataset.csv`).
    * Handles missing values by dropping rows.
    * Encodes categorical features using `LabelEncoder`.
    * Scales numerical features using `StandardScaler`.

-   **Model Training & Evaluation**:
    * Trains and evaluates several popular classification algorithms including:
        * AdaBoost Classifier
        * Gradient Boosting Classifier
        * Random Forest Classifier
        * Logistic Regression
        * Extra Trees Classifier
        * Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
        * Bagging Classifier (with DecisionTree as base estimator)
    * Uses `StratifiedKFold` for robust cross-validation during evaluation.
    * Reports key performance metrics for each model on the test set: Accuracy, F1-Score (weighted), ROC-AUC (if supported), Classification Report, and Confusion Matrix.

-   **Model Comparison**:
    * Visualizes the test accuracy of all trained models using a bar plot for easy comparison.

-   **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
    * Applies `GridSearchCV` to optimize hyperparameters for the top-performing model (Random Forest in this case).

-   **Feature Importance Analysis**:
    * Visualizes the feature importances derived from the final optimized model to provide insights into feature contributions.

-   **Overfitting Check**:
    * Compares training and test accuracies of the final model to identify potential overfitting.
    * Generates learning curves to visually assess bias and variance, and how performance changes with training set size.

-   **Model Stability**:
    * Calculates the standard deviation of cross-validation scores for multiple models to provide an indication of their stability.

-   **Model Persistence**:
    * Saves the entire trained pipeline (including the best model, `StandardScaler`, and `LabelEncoders`) using `joblib` for future predictions without needing to retrain.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.x
* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `scikit-learn`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`
* `joblib`

You can install these using `pip`:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib

### Dataset

This project expects a CSV file named `final dataset.csv` to be present in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook. This dataset should contain features and a target column named 'Class' for binary classification.

### Running the Notebook

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
2.  **Place your dataset:** Ensure `final dataset.csv` is in the root directory of the cloned repository.
3.  **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
    jupyter notebook Diabetes-detection.ipynb
4.  **Execute all cells:** Run all the cells sequentially within the Jupyter environment to perform the analysis and model training.

## Code Structure

  * `Diabetes-detection.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook that contains all the Python code for the machine learning pipeline.
  * `final dataset.csv`: (Expected) The input dataset for the project.
  * `final_model_with_preprocessing.pkl`: (Output) The saved machine learning pipeline (scaler, label encoders, and final model).

## Results

The notebook will output detailed performance metrics for each model, including classification reports and confusion matrices. A summary table of model accuracies, F1-scores, and ROC-AUCs will be displayed.

After hyperparameter tuning, the best parameters for Random Forest and its performance on the test set will be printed.

Key visualizations include:

  * A bar plot comparing the test accuracies of all evaluated models.
  * A bar plot illustrating the feature importances of the final optimized Random Forest model.
  * Learning curves for the final model, helping to diagnose bias and variance.

## Saved Model Usage

The entire trained pipeline (including the `RandomForestClassifier` model, `StandardScaler`, and `LabelEncoders`) is saved as `final_model_with_preprocessing.pkl`. This file can be easily loaded to make predictions on new data.
